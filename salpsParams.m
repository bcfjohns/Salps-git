%Parameters for the salp body 
%
%all frames of a single body are assumed to be aligned with CS1 (the front
%connection), which is then rotated with respect to the adjoining frame
%(the back connection of the previous salp).
%z points in the direction of forward travel. x is the "left-right"
%direction where salps are to the left and right of each other.
%%=================================================================
% CURRENTLY ARBITRARY!
sMass = 1; %about 40 grams %Mass of the salp

% CURRENTLY ARBITRARY!
sInertia = eye(3); %moment of inertia tensor of the salp.


%CS1->CG
%vector pointing from the forward connection point (CS1) to the center of
%gravity (CG) in components of the body coordinate frame.
frontConnect = [0 -sRadius*1 -sLength]; 

%CG->CS2
%vector pointing from the center fo gravity (CG) to the back connection
%point (CS2) in components of the body coordinate frames.
backConnect = [0 sRadius*1 -sLength];

%CG->CS3
%the vector from the center of gravity to where the propulsion acts (CS3)
propulsionPosition = [0 0 -sLength]; %[0 sRadius*0.5 -sLength*0.5];

%CS2_prev->CS1_current
%orientation vector of Euler angles (x y z) of one salp with respect to the
%previous salp. Orientation of CS1 to adjoining.
connectR = [-34.517432721525040 -49.640423926365756 0];
%can use this to set the initial orientation fo the salp, when there's only
%one.

relRotInit = [0 0]; %the initial angles of the universal joint between salps

%Center of pressure position
COPPosition = [0 0 -sLength];

%spring constant for springs joining a small mass that has the drag force
%applied to it to the main salp body.
